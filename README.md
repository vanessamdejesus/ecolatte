# EcoLatté: Sip Smarter, Spend Less


What if your coffee could help save the planet?!

Introducing **EcoLatté**: Sip Smarter, Spend less.

Climate change is not a new phenomenon — but are you aware of how it is affecting your coffee?

In regions like Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns are creating ideal conditions for pests like the coffee borer beetle and diseases such as coffee leaf rust.

These threats have already led to a **190% increase in pesticide use** over the past decade, with millions of kilograms of toxic chemicals applied to combat infestations.

This not only drives up production costs but also puts the safety and quality of the coffee at risk.

At **EcoLatté**, we offer a solution: our genetically modified coffee beans are engineered to resist pests, pathogens, and heat stress.

By reducing reliance on harmful pesticides and ensuring a more stable, higher-quality product, our beans provide a **sustainable, long-term solution** for coffee producers facing the pressures of a changing climate.

With EcoLatté, you can offer your customers cleaner, more consistent coffee while protecting your supply chain from climate-induced disruptions.
